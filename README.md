# What does this do?

The primary goal of this plugin is to change the order of the attributes when creating an `IBOutlet`. By default, Xcode uses `(strong|weak), nonatomic`, but everyone knows that The Right Wayâ„¢ to declare a propery is `nonatomic, (strong|weak)` and this plugin fixes that. 

You're welcome.
